# CMPM-120---Physics

### [Click here to see the game.](https://bxviu.github.io/CMPM-120---Physics/)


Process requirements:\
**Your GitHub repository must show a history of incremental commits with useful commit messages, tracing back to an empty repository at the start.**\
I have committed multiple times, describing what I remember adding in the commit.

**Your README.md file describes:**\
**Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game)**\
At the top of the README

**How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created**\
The only data assets I used were the humanoid, bow, and arrow.\
I created them all myself in Adobe Illustrator.


Gameplay/Experience requirements:\
**The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**\
The continuous input is that the player can hold the mouse to charge the velocity that is given to the arrow, as well as move the mouse on the screen to direct the angle of the arrow.

The discrete input is the arrow's movement once it is released.

**The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**\
The arrows need to successfully hit the opponents multiple times.

**3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**\
Level 1 - Simple Introduction Level\
Level 2 - Test Out Knowledge\
Level 3 - Introduction of a new enemy\
Timed Level - Survive waves of enemies for 90 seconds

**Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**\
I have a main menu, summary screen, and credits.\
The Main Menu has all 3 levels, plus a timed mode, and credits.\
The Summary screen has stats for the level the player was in.
